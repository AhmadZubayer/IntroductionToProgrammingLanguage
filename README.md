# IntroductionToProgrammingLanguage
This repository contains foundational concepts and beginner-friendly examples for various programming languages, including C, C++, Java, and C#. It is intended as a resource for beginners exploring programming languages and object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. The content reflects notes and examples I used as a beginner to build my programming knowledge.

The code examples and notes in this repository are created from my own practice and the following sources:
